            <h2>About PetSwasthya</h2>
            <p>PetSwasthya is not just a business idea—it’s a venture born out of my personal experiences as a pet owner in India, where accessing quality care for pets is often challenging, especially in semi-urban and rural areas.</p>
            <p>What makes PetSwasthya special is its commitment to giving back. A portion of the profits will be directed toward providing essential care and support to street dogs, a cause I am deeply passionate about.</p>
